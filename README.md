# financial_tracker
A financial tracker created using traditional web-based technologies on the front-end and back-end. Note that for this to work, you will need to use a MySQL database and edit the details found in config.php. Make sure that database and table names match as required in the files. 

This was created for family use - so that each member of the family can see how much the others are spending and on what they are spending. You can allocate a monthly budget to yourself, create different categories for the family, add expenses, check statistics, sort expenses by date, and a lot more. This was created because I couldn't find a similar app that had the functionality of viewing your family members' expenditures.
